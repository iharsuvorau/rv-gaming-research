## Raman Voranau

(b. MCMLXXXV)

I have nearly a decade of experience in the cultural and creative industries. I worked in Vitebsk Museum of Arts studying local arts scene and curating exhibitions. In an event agency, I developed the programmes, promoted events and communicated with the performers. While being a project manager in a not-for-profit organisation, I administrated educational projects for the early career creative workers.

In 2017â€“2018, I completed MSc programme at the University of Glasgow, doing research about digital creative workers and their international mobility. Currently, I am engaged in Masters by Research course at the University of South Australia studying leisure experiences of the video game developers based in South Australia.

I am from Belarus. I have a brave daughter, listen ambient and 99PI, and read books on history and non-fiction comics.
