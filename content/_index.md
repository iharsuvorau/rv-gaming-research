## About the project

Hello, world.

This website is dedicated to my research project undertaken at the University of South Australia. I interview video game developers, literally asking them about the following things:

* how their leisure looks like,
* what activities they prefer,
* how this is all related to their work and individual well-being.

Although someone could assume that ‘game’ is a key for the questions, the reality is much richer.

Yes, this is a big question if we can still talk about classic ‘leisure’ in relation to the creative workers. Particularly, in the pandemic and post-pandemic societies. So, I rather examine how video game industry workers experience a mixture of leisure and work.

### Why am I doing this?

Participation in a range of leisure activities contributes differently. Customising our free time, we can achieve different experiences and make them more meaningful. Particularly, I am interested in how participation in culture and arts influence people from creating jobs.

I am working from Adelaide — a beautiful city in South Australia. My primary focus on local video game developers is for two reasons:

1. Video game industry community in South Australia deserves more attention and support.
2. I am not a very ‘global’ guy and try to work for the local communities.

### Are you related to South Australia’s video game industry?

I would love to hear your thoughts. Please, let me know by either way mentioned in the end. Or fill the 2-minutes survey here and I will contact you.

Do you know anyone from the industry? Please, send them the link on this website. I will be happy to interview anyone who is willing to improve the understanding of the SA video game scene.

### The last thing

I will present my results. Rigorously for journals. Highlights for the media. All together plus lots of anecdotes in special presentations for the study participants.
